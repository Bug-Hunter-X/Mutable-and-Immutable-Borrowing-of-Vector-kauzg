This repository contains a simple Rust program demonstrating a common error involving mutable and immutable borrows of a vector.  The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code, which attempts to push a new element onto the vector while an iterator is also borrowing the vector immutably. This violates Rust's borrowing rules and results in a compile-time error. The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.rs`, shows how to avoid this error by consuming the iterator or cloning the vector before making further mutable changes.
